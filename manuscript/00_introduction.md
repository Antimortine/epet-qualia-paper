# Introduction: Towards an Integrative Theory of Consciousness

## The Enigma of Consciousness

Consciousness is a profound phenomenon. Each of us has direct access to our subjective experience: seeing colors, hearing sounds, feeling emotions, and being aware of ourselves. This inner qualitative aspect—the "what is it like?" [@nagelWhatItLikeBat1980, pp. 159–160]—constitutes the phenomenal character of consciousness. This subjectivity poses a fundamental problem: How to reconcile this private, qualitative world with the objective picture from science? How does the physical brain generate the seemingly immaterial **qualities of experience**, or **qualia**?

## Existing Approaches and Their Limitations

The challenge of explaining qualia has given rise to a diverse landscape of philosophical theories, each facing significant hurdles. Substance dualism [@swinburneEvolutionSoul1997, xi–xii, 10, 145–60, 322–31], which posits a non-physical mind, struggles with the intractable problem of how such a mind could interact with the physical brain and remains difficult to reconcile with a scientific worldview. At the other extreme, strongly reductive or eliminative forms of physicalism, including illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993, pp. 354–358; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016], attempt to solve the problem by denying the reality of qualia, a move many find counterintuitive as it seems to dismiss the very phenomenon we seek to explain. In the middle ground, panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017, chap. 7–9; @chalmersPanpsychismPanprotopsychism2013] avoids these issues by treating consciousness as a fundamental property of matter, but at the cost of introducing its own profound challenge: the combination problem of how myriad micro-conscious entities could combine to form a unified macro-conscious experience. While each of these approaches offers valuable insights, none has provided a fully satisfactory solution, suggesting that a fruitful path forward may lie in an integrative approach that avoids these metaphysical extremes.

## Introducing the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)

This paper develops and defends such an integrative framework: the **Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)**. Grounded in a **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999, 12; @bedauWeakEmergence1997, p. 377–379], EPET proposes that phenomenal consciousness is neither a non-physical substance nor a fundamental property of matter, but a **real, emergent, and dynamic process** that arises from the specific organization and activity of a complex physical system. To explain how this process realizes qualia, EPET synthesizes insights from two of the most influential paradigms in contemporary cognitive science: **Predictive Processing (PP)** [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010, 127; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013, pp. 1—3; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013, Ch. 1], which explains how the brain generates content-rich models of the world, and **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], which provides a plausible mechanism for how information becomes consciously accessed and integrated. The central thesis of this paper is that qualia can be naturalized through a **constitutive explanation**: they are identical to specific, high-level intrinsic properties of this integrated, embodied predictive process itself.

## Structure of the Argument

The argument of this paper will unfold as follows. **Section 2** will elaborate on the metaphysical foundation of EPET, articulating its commitment to a specific form of non-reductive (weak) emergentism and arguing for its suitability as a middle ground between eliminativism and more metaphysically costly theories. **Section 3** will present the core of the theory's constitutive explanation, detailing how the integration of Predictive Processing and Global Workspace Theory provides the necessary architectural and dynamic properties for the realization of qualia. **Section 4** will then apply this framework to address the 'hard problem' more directly, showing how EPET's approach aims to dissolve the explanatory gap by focusing on realization and deconstructing common problem intuitions. Finally, **Section 5** will briefly discuss potential objections and conclude by summarizing the theory's explanatory strengths and contributions to the ongoing debate on consciousness.
