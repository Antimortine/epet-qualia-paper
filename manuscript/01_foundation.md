# 1. The Metaphysical Foundation of EPET

Any theory of consciousness must be grounded in a metaphysical framework, whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed. EPET adopts **physicalism** as its starting point, the view that everything that exists is either physical or is constituted by and realized in physical processes [@stoljarPhysicalism2024, Ch. 1]. This commitment is not arbitrary; it is motivated by the overwhelming success of the physical sciences and the consistent failure to find evidence for any non-physical substance that interacts with the brain. Furthermore, adopting physicalism allows the theory to remain in productive dialogue with neuroscience and cognitive science, which consistently demonstrate the deep dependence of all known mental phenomena on the physical processes of the brain and body. This stance moves us beyond the intractable interaction problem that has plagued substance dualism since its inception, allowing us to focus on the more tractable, albeit still profound, question of how physical systems can give rise to experience.

However, embracing physicalism does not necessitate embracing strong reductionism or eliminativism—views that often seem to dismiss the phenomenal reality of qualia rather than explain it. EPET charts a middle course through **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999, pp. 15–16; @bedauWeakEmergence1997, p. 377–379]. This position fully acknowledges the reality of subjective experience as a legitimate explanandum while maintaining that it is realized by physical processes. According to this view, consciousness is an **emergent property**: a novel, system-level phenomenon that arises from the specific organization and complex interactions of its underlying physical constituents, but is not itself a property of those constituents in isolation. Much like the liquidity of water is a real property emerging from the interactions of H₂O molecules (which are not themselves liquid), qualia are posited to be real properties emerging from the complex dynamics of neural populations, even though individual neurons are not themselves conscious.

Crucially, EPET commits to a specific, scientifically plausible form of emergence known as **weak, or epistemic, emergence** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997, p. 377–379; @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006, pp. 244–245]. This position carefully distinguishes between ontology and epistemology. Ontologically, it maintains that emergent properties like consciousness are fully dependent on, and realized by, their underlying physical base; no new forces or "downward causation" that violates physical laws are posited [@oconnorEmergentProperties2021, Sec. 2.2.3]. However, epistemically, these high-level properties are often irreducible: they cannot be fully explained, predicted, or understood using only the language of low-level physics. New, higher-level concepts and explanatory models are required. This stance allows EPET to affirm the **reality and causal relevance** of consciousness as a high-level organizational pattern, while remaining fully compatible with the causal closure of the physical world. It provides a stable metaphysical middle ground, treating qualia as real emergent features of the world without resorting to either dualism or panpsychism.
