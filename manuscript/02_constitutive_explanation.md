# 2. The Constitutive Explanation: Integrating Prediction and Global Access

Having established emergentism as a viable metaphysical foundation, the central task becomes identifying the specific architectural principles and dynamic processes from which phenomenal experience emerges. A purely philosophical assertion of emergence is insufficient; a scientifically grounded theory must specify the key components whose interaction constitutes consciousness. EPET proposes that the realization of qualia depends on the synergistic integration of two of the most powerful and empirically supported frameworks in modern cognitive neuroscience: **Predictive Processing (PP)** and **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**. We argue that PP provides the core mechanism for generating rich, content-specific, and graded phenomenal states, while GWT provides the necessary mechanism for their stabilization, integration, and conscious access, which allows them to guide flexible, reportable behavior. It is the dynamic interplay of these two processes, within an embodied system, that constitutes the emergent process we identify with phenomenal consciousness.

Predictive Processing casts the brain not as a passive, bottom-up feature detector, but as an active and sophisticated inference engine that constantly seeks to predict its own sensory inputs [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. At its core, the brain employs a hierarchical generative model to produce top-down predictions about the causes of its sensory signals. These predictions are then compared against the actual bottom-up sensory flow. The crucial information passed up the hierarchy is not the raw sensory data itself, but the **prediction error**—the mismatch between what was predicted and what was received. The brain's fundamental goal is to minimize this error over the long run, which it achieves by continuously updating its generative model. Consequently, what we consciously perceive is not the world as it is, but rather the brain's "best hypothesis" or "controlled hallucination" about the causes of its sensory input—the content of the predictive model that best explains away the prediction errors [@seth_controlled_hallucination]. This framework provides EPET with the fundamental mechanism for the generation of rich and specific experiential content.

While PP provides a powerful account of how the brain generates the content of experience, it does not, on its own, fully explain why some of this content becomes consciously available while the vast majority of predictive processing remains unconscious. What determines the transition from a non-conscious representation to a reportable, subjectively experienced state? To bridge this gap, EPET incorporates the central mechanism of **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. GWT posits that for information to become conscious, it must gain access to a limited-capacity "global workspace," from which it is broadcast to a wide range of specialized, non-conscious cognitive systems. This global availability, or "ignition" in neural terms, is what makes information reportable, available for executive control, and integrated into a unified subjective scene. Thus, GWT provides the crucial architectural component for explaining **conscious access**: it is the mechanism by which a specific, stable, and salient "best hypothesis" from the PP hierarchy is selected, amplified, and made globally available to the organism.

Therefore, within EPET, qualia are not properties of either PP or GWT in isolation, but are **constitutive features of the emergent process of their dynamic integration within an embodied agent**. A specific quale—the "what-it's-likeness" of seeing red, for instance—is identical to the particular state of the globally broadcasted predictive model that has successfully explained away prediction errors about a certain surface property. This integrated state is not an abstract computation; it is an embodied, dynamic pattern. Its specific phenomenal character is determined by the content of the predictive model (the "redness" hypothesis generated by PP), its intensity and clarity are shaped by the model's stability and the precision assigned to the relevant signals, and its entry into consciousness is marked by its global availability (achieved via GWT). In this view, a quale is not something *caused by* the process; it *is* the intrinsic, multifaceted character of this particular kind of organized, self-evaluating, and globally integrated predictive activity unfolding in a living system. This constitutive view provides the foundation for addressing the 'hard problem' directly.
